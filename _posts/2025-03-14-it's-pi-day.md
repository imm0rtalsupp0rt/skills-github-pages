It's Pi Day! March 14; 3-14. In my opinion, the best way to celebrate is with a slice of pie, of course!

But not _just_ a slice a pie. A slice of pie **swirled up inside a milkshake**; compliments of a local eatery called The Cherry Pit Cafe.

They have quite a few pie-types to choose from, but the pecan pie milkshake tastes just like a Snickers bar. Strange but true!

I'll probably get a cherry pie milkshake though, as that's my favorite fruit pie. The chocolate chess is also grand.

"A big whole slice of pie in a milkshake? That's crazy!" you might say. And you might be right.

But there isn't much that tastes better on warm day!
