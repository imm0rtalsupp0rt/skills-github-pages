# Learning to Git

I'm new to Git, and to be honest, I hated it for a long time. It was very confusing getting started, and it didn't seem to help the more I used it.

The GitHub Skills courses have helped, along with the guidance (and incredible patience) of colleagues that spend a lot of time here.

Here's hoping that, with time and practice, I can _git gud_.
